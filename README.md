Molly Helene here. I am new to coding and am looking forward to wrapping my head around all of this. I have been doing layout and design for years, mainly creating training manuals and marketing materials. I am self-taught and use Adobe CC - mostly inDesign. In 2017 I spent most of the year first producing 100 training videos (casting agents, actors, director, videographer, editor, etc.), and then embedding the videos into 6 Powerpoint presentations for a 6-week training. Next I created the print materials for this training. I have put together some websites using Squarespace, and have managed more complex websites, but would like to learn how to build from scratch. Time to get serious!

I like walking. A lot. I walked across America when I was 17. I sing (probably badly), drum (learning the frame drum), dance (like no one is watching because no one is. Ha!), make art and practice xi gong. I enjoy wildlife and am a birder. I live in the desert wilderness on a 5-acre tree-filled homestead with a spring. I'm planting a garden. I drive 2 hours twice a month to go to a grocery store! Cities are fun but I prefer living where it's quiet and serene.
